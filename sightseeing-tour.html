        <img src="./images/Catholic Cathedral of Santorini.jpg" alt="Catholic Cathedral of Santorini">
        <p>The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist[1] (Greek: Καθεδρικός ναός του Αγίου Ιωάννη του Βαπτιστή) is a parish
            of the Roman Catholic Church in Fira, on the island of Santorini in Greece.[2][3] It serves as the cathedral
            of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santorini (Dioecesis Sanctoriensis or Επισκοπή Θήρας) which was created in
            1204.

            The cathedral is located in the city center, in the Catholic neighborhood. The current church, a baroque
            structure of blue-gray and cream, was built in 1823. It was completely restored and rebuilt in 1970, after
            the earthquake of 1956.</p>

        <img src="./images/Santorini Cable Car.jpg" alt="Santorini Cable Car">
        <p>Cable car provides you a safe transport from the old port to the capital of Santorini, Fira. Some people can
            also use it just to admire the amazing view of the stunning caldera, the sea and the volcano from a 220
            meters altitude.</p>

        <img src="./images/Archaeological Museum of Thera.jpg" alt="Archaeological Museum of Thera">
        <p>An extraordinary and very interesting museum lies in the center of Fira, the capital of Santorini, very close
            to the cable car. The Archaeological Museum of Thera is a very educational small gem that offers an insight
            into the island’s past and proves how sophisticated the civilizations that preceded us were. It was built in
            1960 by the Ministry of Public Works since the previous one, constructed in 1902, had collapsed during the
            destructive earthquake of 1956.</p>
        <h2>Orthodox Metropolitan Church of Santorini</h2>
        <img src="./images/Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral.jpg" alt="Orthodox Metropolitan Church of Santorini" width="50%" height="50%">
        <p>The Orthodox Metropolitan Church of Santorini, Cyclades: This church sits prominently towards the bottom of
            the town of Fira and can be seen from a great distance and from many parts of Santorini. The church was
            built in 1827 and offers an impressive view to the caldera and the volcano of Santorini. In the year 1956,
            the building was damaged during the catastrophic earthquake but renovated soon after.

            It is a beautiful cathedral with a nice mosaic on the outside and an impressive bell tower. Rolling arches
            create a peaceful courtyard. The church's inside is adorned with beautiful frescoes made by the local artist
            Christoforos Asimis.</p>
        <h2>Museum of Prehistoric Thera</h2>
        <img src="./images/Museum of Prehistoric Thera.jpg" alt="Museum of Prehistoric Thera">
        <p>The Museum of Prehistoric Thera (Greek: Μουσείο Προϊστορικής Θήρας) is located in Fira, on the island of
            Santorini in Greece. It was built on the site of the old Ypapanti Church which was destroyed in the 1956
            Amorgos earthquake.

            The Museum houses a very large number of ancient artifacts from various excavations on Santorini, such as at
            Akrotiri (southwest part of the island, located on a peninsula), and at the nearby Potamos site.

            The earliest excavations on Santorini were conducted by French geologist F. Fouque in 1867, after some local
            people found old artifacts at a quarry. Later, in 1895-1900, the digs by German archeologist Baron Friedrich
            Hiller von Gaertringen revealed the ruins of ancient Thera on Mesa Vouno.[1] He focused on the settlements
            of 9th century BC there, believed to be a Spartan colony.

            Also, a little later, R. Zahn excavated in the locality of Potamos, under the auspices of the German
            Archaeological Institute at Athens.

            The main excavations at Akrotiri were conducted under the direction of the Archaeological Society of Athens.
